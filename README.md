# Spring 4.0.0M2 Websocket Demo

This is a demo of using WebSockets and SockJS in a simple web application.

The web application is a simple name service where, after typing your name, will give you a "Ninja" name.  During the process of getting the name, all other connected clients are notified that a new name was generated.

More instructions on setup and running will be added here later...
